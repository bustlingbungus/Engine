# Bungus Engine Project Template

This code serves as a template file for creating a project in bungus engine. Clone this repository, make sure you have properly included the engine files as a system header, and change the directories in `CMakeLists.txt` if needed. Simply add code in `Init` to add object and scenes into the game.
